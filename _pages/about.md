I am currently pursuing a Bacholer's degree in Computer Science at [ShanghaiTech University](https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn), with a minor in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics. Since the fall of 2024, I have also been a concurrent international student at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/), which has offered me a broader academic perspective and numerous opportunities for cross-disciplinary collaboration.  

I joined the Mobile Perception Lab at ShanghaiTech University since the spring of 2023, where I work under the guidance of Ph.D. student Hang Su and Prof. Laurent Kneip. My previous projects primarily focused on event-camera-based SLAM for real-time 3D environment understanding and robust motion tracking in dynamic scenarios.

My research interests span computer vision, SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping), machine learning and deep learning.

Traditional hedging strategies often fall short in equity derivatives markets due to their high-dimensional dynamics and stochastic volatility. To address this, we propose a data-driven framework for option hedging that integrates temporal market modeling with nonlinear predictive architectures. Our system comprises: (1) a robust preprocessing module that aligns time series, imputes data under causality constraints, and computes PnL and exposure trajectories; (2) a principled labeling mechanism that transforms exposure-adjusted returns into smooth, rank-preserving targets; and (3) a multi-layer perceptron trained via stratified cross-validation to learn risk-sensitive decision policies. Built atop this foundation is a modular trading engine that dynamically rebalances the portfolio through label-prioritized selection and adaptive sell-order management, effectively aligning exposure with market opportunities in real time.

</div><div markdown="1">

**Finished Works**:  
1.Engineered a fault-tolerant data pipeline for financial time series, incorporating custom temporal imputation and non-trading day exclusion logic, ensuring robust option lifecycle reconstruction.

2.Proposed and implemented a theoretically grounded labeling function that maps PnL-exposure ratios into continuous preference scores, preserving directional semantics under both positive and negative regimes.

3.Trained a deep MLP architecture with hyperparameter tuning and 5-fold cross-validation, achieving stable generalization across diverse market conditions and minimizing out-of-sample prediction error.

4.Developed a two-stage decision-making algorithm that orchestrates exposure tracking through priority-based liquidation and reallocation, enabling adaptive trade execution under soft budget constraints.

5.Integrated the full pipeline into a real-time simulation framework, supporting continuous decision rollouts, exposure drift correction, and trade performance monitoring at daily resolution.

Wine quality prediction involves complex dependencies among physicochemical features, many of which are collinear or noisy. In this context, PCA proves especially powerful‚Äînot as a generic dimensionality reduction tool, but as a targeted method for denoising redundant feature spaces and isolating signal-bearing subspaces that align with latent quality drivers. Simultaneously, the use of Huber Loss addresses a critical modeling challenge: the presence of label noise and heavy-tailed residuals, which can severely distort optimization under standard squared error. By smoothly interpolating between L2 sensitivity and L1 robustness, Huber Loss enables stable convergence and improved generalization, particularly in small-to-medium data regimes where overfitting to outliers is a major risk. Together, these two components‚Äîeigenstructure-guided feature compression and statistically grounded robustification‚Äîform a principled foundation for our hybrid pipeline, allowing classical models like logistic regression and ensemble methods like XGBoost to operate closer to their theoretical optimal regimes.

**Finished Works**:  
1. Conducted a thorough benchmarking of multiple models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) for quality prediction on a real-world dataset from the wine industry.  
2. Employed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce feature dimensionality, improve interpretability, and eliminate noisy correlations.  
3. Incorporated Huber Loss into neural network and XGBoost models, significantly mitigating the influence of outliers and enhancing generalization on test data.  
4. Designed a comprehensive ablation study evaluating the impact of model choice, loss function, and feature preprocessing, identifying optimal configurations for predictive performance.  
5. Visualized and analyzed model behavior and prediction error metrics using MSE and Kaggle submissions, confirming improved robustness and lower error rates through hybrid techniques.

[**Paper**](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00170-024-14372-3)
- A grasping pose estimation framework based on point cloud fusion and filtering is proposed, which solves the problem of sparse point clouds at object edges and facilitates more robust grasping.
- A novel pose estimation method based on viewpoint selection is introduced, which first uses an RGBD cam
era to reconstruct the point cloud model of the object, and then applies the principle of viewpoint selection to 
obtain the 6D pose of the object.
- We demonstrate that through pose estimation and point cloud fusion, this grasping framework can accurately grasp object from a single-view RGBD image, maintaining a high success rate even in cluttered scenes.
