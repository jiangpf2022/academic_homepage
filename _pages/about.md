<h2 style="color:red"> NOTE: THE WEBSITE IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION, ALL OF THE INFORMATIONS HERE MAY NOT BE TOTALLY CORRECT RIGHT NOW.</h2>

I am currently pursuing a Bacholer's degree in Computer Science at [ShanghaiTech University](https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn), with a minor in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics. Since the fall of 2024, I have also been a concurrent international student at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/), which has offered me a broader academic perspective and numerous opportunities for cross-disciplinary collaboration.  

I joined the Mobile Perception Lab at ShanghaiTech University since the spring of 2023, where I work under the guidance of Ph.D. student Hang Su and Prof. Laurent Kneip. My previous projects primarily focused on event-camera-based SLAM for real-time 3D environment understanding and robust motion tracking in dynamic scenarios.

My research interests span computer vision, SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping), machine learning and deep learning.

Because of the irregularities on the object's surface and variations in lighting conditions, point cloud images obtained from a single perspective often contain significant gaps and errors at the object's edges, which can lead to inaccurate grasping pose estimations. To tackle these challenges, this article proposes a practical robot grasping method based on 6D pose estimation and point cloud fusion. First, 6D pose estimation is conducted, utilizing the results from model point cloud and pose estimation to complete the input point cloud through ICP (Iterative Closest Point). Subsequently, the resulting complete object point cloud is used to estimate the 6D grasping pose of the object with the help of the grasping direction estimation network.

</div><div markdown="1">

**Finished Works**:
1. Establish a model-free 6D pose estimation network based on perspective matching. Construct and train the pose estimation network to achieve precise pose estimation for seen objects and a rough estimation method for untrained objects. Create a pose refinement network for untrained objects when sparse point clouds are accessible.

2. Propose a point cloud fusion and filtering method based on pose estimation. This method addresses the issue of point cloud gaps at the edge of objects when the robot collects samples from a single perspective. The point cloud fusion method is designed to utilize the output of pose estimation to fill in the gaps in the input point cloud and remove noise.

3. Perform grasp pose estimation using the completed point cloud. Utilizing the grasping angle prediction network and a fast search strategy, the completed point cloud enhances the stability of grasping pose generation, thereby improving the success rate of grasping and its robustness.

4. Test the system in simulation and the real world using a 6DoF robot, a Realsense camera, and a laptop (ROS/Ubuntu 20.04) as the host computer.

Because of the inherent volatility in options markets and the intricate interplay between price fluctuations and exposure, single-point strategies often fail to adequately address the dynamic risk profiles in equity derivative hedging. To tackle these challenges, this project proposes a practical hedging framework that integrates real-time data processing, a novel labeling method for risk-return assessment, and a neural network for accurate decision-making.

**Finished Works**:
1. Perform the recognition and segmentation of surgical instruments and lesion tissues based on Yolov8, and determine the spatial position of the end of the surgical instruments.

2. Build a vision and robotic arm fusion system, perform hand-eye calibration of cameras and robotic arms, and execute basic robot actions for visual servo.

[**Paper**](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00170-024-14372-3)
- A grasping pose estimation framework based on point cloud fusion and filtering is proposed, which solves the problem of sparse point clouds at object edges and facilitates more robust grasping.
- A novel pose estimation method based on viewpoint selection is introduced, which first uses an RGBD cam
era to reconstruct the point cloud model of the object, and then applies the principle of viewpoint selection to 
obtain the 6D pose of the object.
- We demonstrate that through pose estimation and point cloud fusion, this grasping framework can accurately grasp object from a single-view RGBD image, maintaining a high success rate even in cluttered scenes.
